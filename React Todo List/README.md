# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React ToDo List

### Background
I wanted to learn more about front end development with more than just HTML and CSS. React adds javascript and the ability for components. Here I made a ToDo list utilizing what I have learn.

1. Basic JavaScript
 - Used const, functions, and exporting various things
2. Created components using React library
3. Put together to form a functioning todo list
 -  Add items
 -  Funtioning delete button
 -  Local storage for continual/ future uses
